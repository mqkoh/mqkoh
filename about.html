      About <strong>EMPOWER</strong>
      </h2>

      <p class="About text">
      For this project, we have combined our strengths to address two problems.
      <br /><br />
      The first problem we realised was that women and girls often don't take proactive measures to empower themselves to take up leadership    positions. When one cannot even imagine the possibility of doing a certain thing or living a certain way, it naturally follows that they will not strive to achieve those things.
      <br /><br />
      The second problem we talked about was the general lack of awareness, especially among women, of the inequality men themselves face. Because of this disparity in treatment, there are people who no longer believe in feminism or gender equality. "Women are just as bad" is a common rhetoric.
      <br /><br />
      So in order to solve these two problems, we would like to offer a source of information where women can find good role models to emulate, as well as become aware that inequality is not always only directed towards them. We hope that everyone can find something suitable for themselves through the array of resources that are available here and hopefully our website will be able to <strong>EMPOWER</strong> you.
      <br /><br />
